### Project Overview

 In this project we analyze weather dataset  using numpy and pandas concept of python .We'll be working with a csv file that contains weather data for each hour in 2012. There are many interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we will explore with the help of this dataset. Apply all the numpy and pandas skills learned so far to analyze the data.


### Learnings from the project

 You are able to count the categorical and numerical columns in given dataset.
You are able to learn groupby,pivot table,aggregation and value_counts concept of pandas.
You learn all this implemented with help of function definition and their calling.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project ,i had first loaded that path using pandas dataframe framework and do cleaning of data and get desired results. In this I had declared all the functions in starting that help me to get my desired output and function calling is done at the end portion of project.
